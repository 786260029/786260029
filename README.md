## Hi there 👋

I am a student majoring in data science and big Data technology at Fuzhou University.
I learned C. Python, data structure and other basic computer courses, machine learning, database, data mining and other professional knowledge. I'm interested in big models and big data architectures.
The development plan for the next three years is to take the postgraduate entrance exam and study majors related to big data. I think the knowledge I learned in the undergraduate period of big data is relatively shallow, which is not enough to meet the current market demand. I hope that I can have at least one scientific research experience and internship experience in related majors on the basis of completing the course content during my undergraduate study. I hope that I can learn enough skills during the postgraduate period so that I can be competent for the work in a large company for a long time and not lose my job.
